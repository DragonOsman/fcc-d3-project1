# DragonOsman D3 Data Visualization Bar Chart Project

This is my solution to the "Data Visualization Projects - Visualize Data with a Bar Chart" challenge on Free Code Camp.  I'm using JavaScript and SASS (SCSS syntax).  No JS frameworks are used because D3 doesn't work well with virtual DOM elements.
